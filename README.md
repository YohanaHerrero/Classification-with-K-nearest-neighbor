Use the K-Nearest-Neighbor supervised learning algorithm to classify data points into different groups or categories.

The table teleCust1000t.csv contains personal information, which is used to categorize individuals into different groups (column name 'custcat'):
Group 1: Basic-service
Group 2: E-Service customers
Group 3: Plus Service
Group 4: Total Service

With the K-Nearest-Neighbour, I will train the model on a training dataset. I will then predict to which category new individuals (test dataset) belong 
and assess the model accuracy. I previously normalize the data using preprocessing.
